# TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma & Zod Practic

This repository contains my practice exercises and code snippets while learning TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma ORM.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed programming language built on JavaScript
- **Next.js** - React framework for production-grade applications
- **Prisma** - Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript
- **Zod** - TypeScript-first schema validation library

## About This Repo

This is my personal playground for experimenting with TypeScript and related technologies. Here I practice:

- Building type-safe applications
- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Database operations with Prisma
- Schema validation using Zod
- Integrating these tools together

Nothing fancy - just hands-on learning and code exploration! Feel free to browse through the different practice examples and experiments.
